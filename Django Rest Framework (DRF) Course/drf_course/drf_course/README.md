# Django Rest Framework (DRF) Course
DRF and building API application
***
***

## Prerequisites
- Python=>3.10

## Considerations
Optional docker containers added to simplify the build. 
If you want to use the docker build you should install Docker and Docker Compose on your local machine.

We will be calling our API throughout the next 8 modules. Requests are written in (Curl)[https://curl.se/] and (Httpie)[https://httpie.io/]. 

(Httpie)[https://httpie.io/] provides a clean terminal output which is handy for this type of project. You will need to install it locally if you want to use the commands.
>Note: (Httpie)[https://httpie.io/] is pre-installed in the docker container.
